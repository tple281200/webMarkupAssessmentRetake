                            Taekwondo is an art of self-defense which is basically the use of the hand and foot, with the aim of improving physical strength and
                        learning the way to protect ourselves. For this reason, Taekwondo is often seen as a defense sport rather than a fight sport. Training Taekwondo
                        helps develops discipline, self-confidence, self-control and respect for others. Taekwondo itself has become a competitive sport of the Olympic
                        games since 2000.
                            There are 5 main components for Taekwondo training:
